# auctionLowestBin
Checks auction house for lowest bin of an item and returns a list in .json format

pd: its pretty slow lmao

the parameters are an input of the item you want to search (name has to be exact, but you do not need the whole name of the item, since it looks if the name contains the input. Ex. "hyp" will look for every item that has hyp in its itemname)
